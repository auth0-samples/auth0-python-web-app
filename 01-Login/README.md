# Auth0 Python Web App Sample

This sample demonstrates how to add authentication to a Python web app using Auth0.

# Running the App

To run the sample, make sure you have `python` and `pip` installed.

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and populate it with the client ID, domain, secret, callback URL and audience for your
Auth0 app. If you are not implementing any API you can use `https://YOUR_DOMAIN.auth0.com/userinfo` as the audience. 
Also, add the callback URL to the settings section of your Auth0 client.

Make a folder called `certs` inside the `01-Login` directory and inside the `certs` folder run the following command:

```shell
openssl req -x509 -out localhost.crt -keyout localhost.key -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 -subj '/CN=localhost' -extensions EXT -config <( printf "[dn]\nCN=localhost\n[req]\ndistinguished_name = dn\n[EXT]\nsubjectAltName=DNS:localhost\nkeyUsage=digitalSignature\nextendedKeyUsage=serverAuth")
```

Register `https://localhost:10443/callback` as `Allowed Callback URLs` and `https://localhost:10443`
as `Allowed Logout URLs` in your client settings.

The app will be served at [https://localhost:10443/](https://localhost:10443/).

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies and run `python server.py`. This commands does not need to be executed running the app with docker.

# Running the App with Docker

To run the sample, make sure you have `docker` installed.

To run the sample with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), make sure you have `docker` installed.

Rename the .env.example file to .env, change the environment variables, and register the URLs as explained [previously](#running-the-app).

Run `sh exec.sh` to build and run the docker image in Linux or run `.\exec.ps1` to build 
and run the docker image on Windows.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders),
either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**,or 
enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/jwt) to call your APIs and
**flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules).
